## Description

This project contains all Blender models that I have made,
separated into their appropriate folders.<br>
Some models are completely my own creation and some closely follow online tututorials.

## Format

All models are titled using the format <b> "name_version#". </b> <br />
<b> "name" </b> is the title of the item. <br />
<b>"version#" </b> shows the order in which the models were made.  <br />
(01 is the 1st model of its type, 02 is the 2nd model of its type, etc.) <br />

## Use

Anyone can use, edit, or steal these models. I'm sure you can easily find
better models online anyway.
